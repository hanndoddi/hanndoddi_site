# Fab Lab Ísland Bootcamp 2025

Each year, all the Fab Labs in Iceland pick a place to meet up for our annual bootcamp it's a great chance to sync up, share knowledge, and strengthen the network. It’s a super valuable gathering that definitely plays a role in the success of the Icelandic Fab Lab network. This year, Húsavík was the chosen spot.

## Pre-Bootcamp

I arrived two days early in Akureyri, which turned out to be a great move. It gave me time to plan what I wanted to focus on during the bootcamp, catch up on some work, and settle in. On Monday, I spent the day at Fab Lab Akureyri the fifth lab established in Iceland and one that’s doing really well. It’s especially rewarding to see it thriving, since I was there helping set things up before it opened seven years ago.

I also got to try out their plasma cutter in the metal department a solid machine and really easy to operate. Later, I met with the teachers running the electronics and electrician programs. They were currently working on installing solar panels on the roof, which they plan to use as a study setup for students. Great initiative.

## Traveling to the Bootcamp

The bootcamp officially started on Wednesday, so Tuesday was all about getting there. We had teams traveling in from across the country from Neskaupstaður, Hornafjörður, Selfoss, Reykjavík, Sauðárkrókur, Akureyri, and of course our lab in Ísafjörður.

At 16:00, the Akureyri crew and I headed to the airport to pick up Svavar, my colleague from Ísafjörður. From there, it was about an hour’s drive to Húsavík. We met up with some of the team who had already arrived, along with our hosts: Stefán, the director of the lab in Húsavík, and Flexi, the lab’s project manager. Not a super eventful day, but a nice warm-up the real program kicks off tomorrow.
