# The journey to Shreveport-Bossier Makerfair

In April 2025 I got invited as a guest speaker at a [Makerfair in Shreveport Louisiana](https://shreveport.makerfaire.com/).

## pre Trip

The day before departure to the U.S. I stopped by at Fab Lab Reykjavik to catch up with my colleagues and do some focus work including fine tuning the values and experience I could bring to the Makerfair.

### X tool

at the Lab they just got a new X-tool fiber laser. It's capability to edge circuit boards is quite impressive and a clean process. the traces are also able to be much thinner making it easy to work with smaller components.

## Travel

Traveling over here took it's time but was well used in thinking about the talk and looking at some of the workshops that were planned.

I arrived on friday at Shreveport greeted by Joel who is an amazing community engager. We visited Sci-port.

## Makerfair day

It was amazing to arrive at Sci-port and see all the Makers and guest who had arrived 

### Talk

I gave a talk about how Fab Lab Ísafjöður has managed to work globally and have an impact from the remoteness of the arctic.

Here are the slides I used and some notes with it.
