# Climbing Trees Is Hard: The buffer discovery

In my quest to move like a ninja in the terminal and Neovim, I noticed that many of the top Neovim users don't really use a side tree — and it’s kind of cool.
But it also made me realize: they have discovered a faster way to move.
And the key seems to be buffers!

Until now, I had my <leader><leader> set to recent files, and it made sense. But I remembered when I first set up Kickstart, at the time, it was mapped to buffers. Back then, I didn’t really understand it — I would just see the file I was working on and think, "What's the point?"
Now that I understand Neovim a bit better, and after hearing some tutorials mention buffers, I set it back. I opened a couple of files and ran :Telescope buffers — and there they were.
Even though I had switched files, they weren't lost. They were still in the buffer list.
I noticed random numbers next to them, and some strange letters and symbols.
It was obvious that the numbers were assigned to the buffers, but the letters and symbols required some research. Turns out.

Do we have spelling yes or no I think it looks like we have it! Smelling wronh test
