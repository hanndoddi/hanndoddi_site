# The journey to Shreveport-Bossier Makerfair

In April 2025 I got invited as a guest speaker at a [Makerfair in Shreveport Louisiana](https://shreveport.makerfaire.com/). 


## Post Trip

The day before departure to the U.S. I stopped by at Fab Lab Reykjavik to catch up with my colleagues and do some focus work including fine tuning the values and experience I could bring to the makerfair. 

### X tool 

at the Lab they just got a new X-tool fiber laser. It's cability to edge circuit boards is quite impressive and a cleen process. the traces are also able to be much thinner making it easy to work with smaller componauts.
