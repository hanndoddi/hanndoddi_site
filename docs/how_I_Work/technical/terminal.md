# Terminal

## Kitty

For terminaal emulator I use kitty mainly becouse it has a cat icon and it's name is kitty(I have a weekspot for cats) Beside that it is a powerfull emulator that works fast and is fully custimizable and runs well with nvim.

## Zshell

I use Zsh becouse it has a lot of nice fetures that are easy to configure.


## Starship

A promt to make the prompt bar look nice. I've added collors that I like git intergration and of course a cat.
