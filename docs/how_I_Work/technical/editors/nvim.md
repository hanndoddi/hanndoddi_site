# Neovim (I use neovim btw)

I mainly started to use Neovim becouse I wanted to look like a cool hacker(Don't worry I am not mutch danger) After geting over how cool it looked and spending days configureing it I found out it's acualy a very nice workflow.

## setup

For anyone strating I would recomend kickstart but here is also a video that I whised I had found earlier. I now use a custom setup inspired by kickstart and xxx


## My setup

Your more than welcome to take a look and use my setup. I would how ever recomend that you make Nvim act like how you want to and use tools that you want and remove tools that you don't like. I would also not recomend to try to make it act and look like VS code or other editors if you are happy with them, then why cahnge? Just to look cool?
