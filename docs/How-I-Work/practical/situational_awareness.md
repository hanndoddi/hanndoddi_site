# Situational Awareness

I learned most about situational awareness while volunteering with a SAR (Search and Rescue) team. Since then, I’ve adapted that skill into my everyday life. It’s about paying attention—not just to the task in front of me, but to the context, the people around me, and the systems I’m working within.

I think of it as “noticing things before they become problems.” Whether I’m setting up a workshop, debugging a machine, or helping someone in the lab, I try to stay alert to what’s going on—even if no one’s said anything yet.

There are a few practical things I do when I really need to focus. Sometimes I wear my watch on the right hand. More often, I wear my ring on my index finger—it’s a small physical reminder to be present and pay attention to my surroundings.

## What I Look For

Situational awareness shows up in small moments:

- Is the equipment behaving differently than usual?  
- Is someone struggling but not saying anything?  
- Does the plan still make sense based on how things have shifted?  
- Are people engaged, or just going through the motions?  

These details might not be on a checklist, but they often matter more than what's written down.

## Tools That Help Me Stay Aware

- **Check-ins** — I ask people how things are going, and I actually listen  
- **Body language and tone** — especially in teaching or group work  
- **Environmental cues** — sounds, smells, lights, airflow, layout  
- **Notes and sketches** — to capture what I’m seeing before I forget  
- **Stepping back** — a minute of pause often gives me better perspective than charging forward

## Why It Matters

A lot of problems can be avoided just by noticing sooner. And sometimes, even small actions—like rearranging a table, changing how something’s explained, or making space for someone to speak—can shift things in a better direction.

Situational awareness isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being present.
