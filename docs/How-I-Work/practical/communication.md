# Communication

Clear and practical communication is essential to my work, especially when collaborating with students, teams, or external partners. I prefer to keep things lightweight, visual, and structured whenever possible. I also believe in sharing work early, even if it’s incomplete, to get feedback and improve iteratively. Teaching has taught me that clarity is more important than polish, and that showing is more effective than telling.

## Listening

Listening isn’t passive it’s a skill I try to practice intentionally. Whether I’m working with a team or one-on-one, I aim to:

- Listen without interrupting  
- Watch for what’s not being said  
- Ask clarifying questions to make sure I actually understand  

Listening well helps me identify issues early, improve collaboration, and avoid making assumptions.

## Talking

When I speak, I aim for clarity. I try to adapt my tone and vocabulary depending on who I’m speaking with—whether it’s a student, a colleague, or a guest. I prefer not to overexplain, but I’m always happy to break something down if someone’s stuck.

Sometimes I use analogies or metaphors to explain technical topics. If I see someone get lost, I take a step back and reframe the idea in simpler terms.

## Reading

Reading is part of how I gather context whether I’m reviewing documentation, student submissions, or project proposals. I try to read:

- Slowly the first time  
- With curiosity, not judgment  
- Looking for both meaning and tone  

I also try to be aware of how I read things under pressure, so I don’t misinterpret short or vague messages.

## Writing

I prefer to write clearly and concisely. I use Markdown for most of my documentation and note-taking, and I often rely on visual elements like bullet points, headers, and diagrams to help structure the message.

When I write, I aim to:

- Keep the tone friendly but direct  
- Use simple words over complex ones  
- Share early and revise based on feedback  

Writing helps me think, but it also helps others follow what I’m doing—especially in async collaboration.

## Perspective

Communication isn’t one-size-fits-all. I try to understand where others are coming from what they know, how they feel, and what they might need from me.

This applies especially in international or multicultural settings, where assumptions can lead to confusion. I try to:

- Adapt how I explain things depending on context  
- Avoid jargon unless I know the audience  
- Consider how tone and phrasing might be received  

---

## Negotiating

Sometimes communication involves disagreement or tension. I don’t mind this—as long as we stay respectful and focused on solving the issue.

I try to:

- Stay calm and clear, especially when emotions are high  
- Look for common goals, not just positions  
- Know when to stand firm and when to let go  

Negotiation doesn’t always mean getting my way. It often means helping everyone feel heard and finding a workable outcome.

## Working in Teams

Good team communication isn’t just about talking—it’s about rhythm. I’ve found that keeping people updated, giving quick feedback, and agreeing on how we’ll work together makes a big difference.

When I work in teams, I try to:

- Check in regularly (but not constantly)  
- Ask for input before making big changes  
- Give credit openly and generously  

---

## Working with Individuals

Working one-on-one requires a slightly different tone. I try to be present, encouraging, and aware of how someone prefers to communicate.

This applies whether I’m mentoring, collaborating, or just helping someone figure something out. I try to:

- Give honest, constructive feedback  
- Ask questions before offering advice  
- Match their pace, not rush ahead  

Sometimes, listening and encouragement are more valuable than solving the problem right away.

---

## Tools and Preferences

For my own workflow, I prefer to keep things simple. I mainly use these tools:

- **Markdown** for notes and documentation  
- **Diagrams or screenshots** instead of long explanations  
- **Version control (Git)** to keep communication transparent  

When needed, I can adapt to Notion, Google Drive, Slack, Discord or even Word.

Communication isn’t just a skill—it’s a habit. It’s one of the most important habits to keep in shape.
