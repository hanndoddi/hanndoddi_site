# Brackets (legacy)

Brackets was the first editor I seriously used when learning HTML and CSS.  
It had a clean interface, a live preview feature, and just enough power to feel capable without being overwhelming.

I still have a soft spot for it, it’s where I really started to enjoy writing code.

## Why it mattered

- Helped me learn HTML/CSS in a friendly environment
- Live preview made it feel rewarding and immediate
- Taught me editor basics before I moved on to more advanced tools

---

## Throwback

I actually used Brackets during my [Fab Academy 2015](https://fabacademy.org/2015/eu/students/gunnarsson.thorarinn_b.b/week.1.html).  
It was my first time building and documenting on the web, and Brackets made it approachable and fun.

## Status

Brackets is no longer actively maintained, and I don’t use it anymore.  
But it played an important role in getting me started, and for that it deserves a small space here.

> Some tools come and go but they shape how we work.
