# :fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: Operating System

## Linux Mint üêß

This is my daily driver. It‚Äôs lightweight, stable, and works great for development, especially for embedded work.  
I use the Cinnamon desktop because it stays out of the way and feels familiar.

Below are the tools, languages, and platforms I use regularly within this environment.

### [Terminal tools](terminal.md)

Zsh, fzf, glow, batcat, and more tools that make the terminal a productive space.

### Programming Languages & Tooling

Python, C, Lua, Git, Markdown are languages I work with across platforms.

## Windows ü™ü

I occasionally use Windows for tools like VCarve or when working with students and clients tied to Windows-only software.  
I don‚Äôt use dual boot, virtualization is enough when needed, but Linux is where I live.
