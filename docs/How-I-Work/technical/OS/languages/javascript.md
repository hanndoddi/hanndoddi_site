# JavaScript 

Iâ€™m not actively focused on learning JavaScript, but Iâ€™ve picked up the basics and can understand and modify scripts when needed.

---

## What I Use It For

- Tweaking interactive behavior in templates or plugins (like in MkDocs)
- Editing existing scripts I find online
- Occasionally writing short scripts for small tasks

---

## What I Know

- Basic syntax: variables, functions, conditionals
- `console.log()` for debugging
- DOM manipulation with `document.querySelector()`
- Handling events like button clicks
- Using copy-pasted examples from MDN or Stack Overflow ðŸ˜…

## Notes for Future Me

If I ever decide to go deeper into JavaScript, Iâ€™d like to explore:

- Using it with Node.js for automation
- Understanding modern syntax (ES6+)
- Building small web tools or UI components
