# C

C is my go-to language for low-level embedded work — especially when performance and control matter.

I don’t use it for everything, but when I need direct access to hardware, memory management, or timing-sensitive logic, C gives me what I need.

It’s not always elegant, but it’s solid. And once you learn to work with it, it becomes a powerful tool for building things that run close to the metal.

I mainly use C in microcontroller projects and when working with PlatformIO or custom firmware.
