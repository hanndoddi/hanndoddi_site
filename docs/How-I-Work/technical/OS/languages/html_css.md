# HTML / CSS

I use HTML and CSS when I want to build something that lives on the web — like this site.

I prefer using Markdown most of the time, but I’m comfortable switching to HTML or CSS when I want more control over layout or styling.

I also use CSS when customizing MkDocs Material, or when building simple pages for projects and courses.

My focus is usually on clarity, speed, and function — not perfect pixel design.
