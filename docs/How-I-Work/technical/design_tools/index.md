# :fontawesome-solid-paintbrush: Design Tools

This section includes the tools I use for visual design, 2D and 3D modeling and general creative work.

I’m not a designer in the traditional sense, but I often need to communicate ideas visually, whether that’s through schematics, technical drawings, renders, or illustrations.

These tools help me do that in a way that’s clear, practical, and sometimes even fun.

## Tools

- [Blender 3D](blender.md)
- [Inkscape](inkscape.md)
- [FreeCAD](freecad.md)
- [Photopea](photopea.md)
