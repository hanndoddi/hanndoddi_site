# Blender 3D

I use Blender for 3D visualization, renders, and sometimes modeling enclosures or concepts before moving into CAD.

It’s powerful and complex, but I usually stick to the basics:
- Quick models for demos or visuals
- Animation previews or concept shots
- Exporting STL or 3MF if needed

Blender is overkill for some things — but when I need it, it's hard to beat.
