# :material-lightning-bolt: Electronics 

This section covers the core electronics tools I use when building, debugging, or teaching — from soldering irons and multimeters to oscilloscopes and logic analyzers.

These aren’t tied to specific brands or models. Instead, they reflect how I work with each type of tool in real-world scenarios — what they’re for, how I use them, and practical tips from daily use.

### → [Soldering](soldering.md)
The foundation of hands-on electronics work. Through-hole, SMD, fixes, and best practices.

### → [Multimeter](multimeter.md)
Quick checks, continuity tests, and reading the basics — still one of the most powerful tools.

### → [Oscilloscope](oscillscope.md)
Understanding what's happening in a circuit over time. Analog, digital, and mobile scopes.

### → [Logic Analyzer](logic-analyzer.md)
Looking into digital signals and protocols — I²C, SPI, UART, and more.

More tools may be added here as needed.
