# :material-tools: Techncal

This section is a curated overview of the tools, systems, and platforms I use in my day-to-day work. From writing code and debugging electronics to documenting projects and designing for fabrication.

It‚Äôs not meant to be exhaustive or permanent. Tools come and go. What matters is how they fit into a flow and that flow is always evolving.
