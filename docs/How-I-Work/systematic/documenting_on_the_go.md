# Documenting on the Go

I don’t wait until the end of a project to write things down, I document as I go, and sometimes even *before* I go. That means capturing ideas, progress, and challenges while I’m in the middle of doing the work, not just after it’s finished.

It’s not always polished, but it’s real. And that makes it more useful — both for myself and for others who might read or build on it later.

## My Documentation Triangle

I rely on a simple system made up of three tools:

- **Notebook** – for quick, temporary notes  
  I jot things down fast during work sessions, meetings, or experiments. These notes aren’t meant to last forever — just to hold details until I process or transfer them.

- **Markdown** – for fast and structured documentation  
  Markdown is my go-to format. I can write quickly, use headings and bullet points, and revisit or improve it later. I usually have my laptop nearby, so this fits into my flow naturally.

- **Photos** – to capture context and details  
  I try to be smart about what I take pictures of, useful angles, key steps, or parts I’ll want to reference later. If I don’t have time to explain something fully, I often mark it in the photo with a note or post-it so I can write about it later.

## Why I Document Early

- I forget things fast, this helps me keep track of insights before they fade  
- It’s easier to write about something while I’m still in it  
- It makes debugging, sharing, and teaching smoother  
- It saves time later when I want to turn the work into a report, website, or tutorial

## It’s Not About Being Perfect

I don’t try to make everything beautiful right away. My focus is on:

- Clarity over polish  
- Momentum over formatting  
- Truth over structure (at least at first)

Good documentation doesn’t slow me down, it helps me move forward with more awareness and less guesswork.

## Bonus: Markdown Wins

Markdown hits the sweet spot between raw notes and finished content. It’s:

- Fast to write  
- Easy to format  
- Version-control friendly  
- Works well for both personal notes and public sharing

Whether it ends up in a Git repo, a website, or a PDF. Markdown helps me stay organized without getting stuck in formatting tools.

## Final Thought

I document everything from workshops, talks, what I’m learning, projects, and even random stuff. Others can benefit from my documentation but It’s mainly for myself.
