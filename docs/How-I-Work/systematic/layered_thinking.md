# Layered Thinking

When things get complicated, I don’t try to hold it all in my head at once, I break it into layers.

This mindset helps me make sense of complex systems, especially in projects that involve electronics, code, documentation, or multiple people working together. It’s a way of organizing work so that I can stay focused without losing sight of the big picture.

I don’t mean layers in a strict engineering way (like OSI models or tech stacks), but more like mental layers, zoom levels, perspectives, and stages of thinking.

## How I Use It

- In **electronics**, I might separate power, logic, and mechanical systems  
- In **code**, I think about structure, flow, and interaction layers  
- In **teaching**, I often separate the concept from the tool from the outcome  
- In **planning**, I break things into now / next / later  
- In **writing**, I think about outline → draft → refine  

Layered thinking helps me avoid feeling stuck or overwhelmed. If something isn’t working, I ask:  
> “What layer is this problem really in?”

## Why It Matters

Projects rarely fail because of one thing, it’s often multiple small things interacting. By breaking things into layers, I can trace problems back more clearly and make better decisions about what to change (and when).

It also helps me explain my thinking to others. When I can show someone *what layer* a decision lives in, it’s easier to get aligned — even if we see things differently.

## Example

In a learning environment, I might think about:

- **Layer 1**: The student's mindset and confidence  
- **Layer 2**: The tools and process they’re learning  
- **Layer 3**: The final output or goal  

If something isn’t working, I don’t just focus on the output, I trace it back through the layers to find where the real issue might be.

Layered thinking isn’t a formula it’s a flexible mental model. It helps me stay organized, move forward, and make complexity feel a little more manageable.
