# Decision-Making

Every day brings decisions, big and small and I try to make mine intentionally. Whether it's choosing the right tool, planning a project, or guiding a team, good decision-making is about balancing speed with clarity.

I don't always aim for the "perfect" decision. I aim for one that's well-informed, time-conscious, and adaptable if new info comes in.

## Pattern Recognition

Years of hands-on work help me see patterns quickly in behavior, in signals, in how things break, and how they usually get fixed.

Pattern recognition helps me:

- Spot recurring issues across tools, systems, or people
- Anticipate problems before they fully surface
- Reuse successful strategies in new contexts

It's not magic. It's practice and paying attention to what has worked, what hasn’t, and what feels familiar.

## Analytical Skills

When things get messy, I lean on analysis. I break things down, look at the pieces, and work through how they interact. I try not to rely on hunches unless I've earned them through past experience.

I use analysis to:

- Understand tradeoffs and side effects
- Compare options when none are obvious
- Justify decisions when others need to be on board

Sometimes this means making a chart, sketching a flow, or just sitting quietly to think it through.

## Summary

Decision-making isn’t just a gut feeling, it’s a process shaped by observation, reflection, and action.  
I don’t always get it right on the first try, but I try to get it right over time by listening, adjusting, and learning as I go.
