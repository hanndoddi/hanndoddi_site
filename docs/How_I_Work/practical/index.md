# üõ†Ô∏è Practical

Practical skills are the habits and mindsets that support how I work with others. They show up in teaching, collaboration, communication, and even just paying attention to what's going on around me.

These are the less visible parts of my workflow, but they‚Äôre often the most important in making projects run smoothly and helping people feel supported.

This section includes:

- [Communication](communication.md)  
  How I listen, talk, write, and adapt my communication in teams, teaching, and collaboration.

- [Situational Awareness](situational_awareness.md)  
  How I stay alert to what's happening around me, from technical signals to human dynamics.

- [Emotional Awareness](emotional_awareness.md)  
  How I recognize and respond to emotions‚Äîboth in others and in myself‚Äîto keep work grounded and people-centered.
