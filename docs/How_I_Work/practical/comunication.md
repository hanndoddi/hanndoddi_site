# Communication

Clear and practical communication is essential to my work — especially when collaborating with students, colleagues, or external partners across cultures and disciplines.

I aim to keep things simple, visual, and structured. Not everything needs to be perfect — I believe in sharing work early, even when it's rough. This opens the door for feedback and helps things improve naturally over time.

Teaching has taught me that clarity is more valuable than polish, and that showing is often more effective than explaining.

When it comes to taking notes or sharing ideas, I keep things straightforward. I mostly rely on three tools:

- Markdown for writing and documentation  
- Diagrams and screenshots when visuals say more than words  
- Git for tracking changes and collaborating
- Pencil and paper

The tools aren't the point, they're just the means. What matters is making things understandable, useful, and open.

When needed, I can adapt to whatever the situation calls for, Notion, Google Drive, Slack, Discord, even Word.
