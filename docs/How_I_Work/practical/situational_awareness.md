# Situational Awareness

Whether I'm working in a lab, a school, or online, I try to stay aware of what's happening around me — not just technically, but socially and practically.

Situational awareness helps me:
- Recognize when something needs attention (a machine, a student, a deadline)
- Adjust to changing conditions
- Notice opportunities or risks others might miss

It’s about paying attention — not just to the work, but to the people and the space I’m working in.  
This mindset is especially important in shared environments and collaborative projects.

I don’t always get it right, but I try to stay present, responsive, and aware of the bigger picture.
