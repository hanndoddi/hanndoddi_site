# ðŸ§  Logical

Logical thinking is definitely my comfort zone and something that comes naturally to me. Iâ€™ve learned to channel it into strengths and stay aware of its limitations.  
It helps me break down problems, test assumptions, and make thoughtful decisions, whether Iâ€™m debugging a circuit, planning a workshop, or collaborating with others.

This section explores four areas:

- [Critical Thinking](/How_I_Work/logical/critical_thinking/)  
  How I question assumptions, reason through challenges, and pay attention to the details that matter.

- [Decision-Making](/How_I_Work/logical/decision_making/)  
  How I use pattern recognition and analysis to choose paths forward, even when the answer isnâ€™t obvious.

- [Problem Solving](/How_I_Work/logical/problemsolving/)  
  How I approach problem solving, whether itâ€™s general, electronics-based, or programming related.

- [Rapid Prototyping](/How_I_Work/logical/rapid_prototyping/)  
  My mindset around fast iterations, working with what I have, and learning through action.

These skills support everything I doâ€”from teaching and prototyping to troubleshooting and planning.
