# Rapid Prototyping

I tend to work in fast cycles — building things quickly to test ideas and see what works in practice.

This approach helps me avoid overthinking or spending too much time planning something that might not work. I’d rather build a rough version, learn from it, and iterate. It’s less about polish and more about momentum.

## Why "Rapid" Prototyping?

Prototyping doesn’t always have to be fast. Sometimes it’s about detail, long-term design, or showing something to a client. Rapid prototyping is different—it's more about speed, testing ideas quickly, and learning fast.

It’s not about skipping quality, it’s about reducing hesitation. The goal is to try something real before spending too long thinking about it. If it works, great. If not, I’ve only lost time I was willing to spend.

## Core Principles

- **Start before you're ready** - I don’t wait for the perfect conditions. If I have an idea, I sketch it, mock it up, or build a version with what I’ve got.
- **Use what’s available** - I love working with scrap, leftovers, and constraints. They help me move faster and stay creative.
- **Function over form** - My goal is to get something working, not to make it look pretty (at least not right away).
- **Test early and often** - I like getting feedback as soon as possible, even if the idea isn’t fully baked.

## Tools I Often Use

- **Cardboard and tape** for physical layouts
- **Breadboards and jumpers** for electronics
- **Markdown and plain text** for documentation drafts
- **Microcontrollers like RP2040** for embedded ideas
- **Scripting and CLI tools** for quick automation

## Lessons from Prototyping

- Sometimes the prototype _is_ the final version.
- Sometimes it’s a total failure and that’s fine.  
  I always learn something, even if it’s just what not to do.
- The faster I try something, the faster I can move on (or double down).

## Where I Apply It

This mindset shows up across everything I do:

- **Electronics** - building test circuits before designing a PCB
- **Code** - writing quick scripts or modifying examples to test ideas
- **Workshops** - prototyping a teaching method before rolling it out
- **Machines** - rigging a temporary fix to see if a solution is viable

> A quick test to see if I could make an injection mold using laser-cut acrylic. Took less than an hour to design and assemble. I used hot glue for test results — it worked well enough to prove the idea.
