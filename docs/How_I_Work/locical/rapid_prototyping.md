# Rapid Prototyping

I tend to work in fast cycles — building things quickly to test ideas and see what works in practice.

This approach helps me avoid overthinking or spending too much time planning something that might not work. I’d rather build a rough version, learn from it, and iterate.

For me, prototyping is about:
- Working with what’s available
- Accepting that the first version won’t be perfect
- Getting feedback as early as possible

Sometimes the prototype becomes the final version. Other times it shows me what not to do — which is just as valuable.

This mindset applies whether I’m working with electronics, code, documentation, or even teaching materials.
