# How I Work

This section is a window into how I approach projects, solve problems, and build systems, both technically and practically.  
It covers the tools I use, the methods I rely on, and the mindset I bring into my work as a maker, educator, and technician.

Each section reflects a part of my workflow, not just what I use, but **how and why I use it**.
