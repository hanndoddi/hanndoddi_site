# Spiral Development

My work rarely follows a straight line. Instead, I often return to the same project or idea multiple times — each time adding a new layer, fixing something, or refining the concept.

That’s why I relate more to spiral development than linear planning.

It’s a process of:
- Revisiting things with fresh perspective
- Learning through repetition and iteration
- Gradually improving outcomes without restarting from scratch

This is especially useful when working with limited time or resources — I can push a project forward even if I can’t finish it all at once.

Spiral development lets things evolve naturally, without needing everything to be perfect from the beginning.
