# Spiral Development

My work rarely follows a straight line. Instead, I often return to the same project or idea multiple times each time adding a new layer, fixing something, or refining the concept.

That’s why I relate more to *spiral development* than linear planning.

I was introduced to this mindset during Fab Academy, and I’ve used it ever since, especially in rapid prototyping and time-constrained projects.

## What It Looks Like

Spiral development is a process of:

- Revisiting things with a fresh perspective  
- Learning through repetition and iteration  
- Gradually improving outcomes without restarting from scratch  
- Moving forward with what’s possible *now*, not waiting for perfect conditions  

Instead of doing everything at once, I work in cycles small improvements, lessons learned, and momentum.

## Why It Works for Me

- It reduces pressure to get things right the first time  
- It makes experimentation safer, I can try, fail, and improve  
- It helps me use feedback as fuel instead of frustration  
- It fits the realities of teaching, prototyping, and working with limited time or resources

I don’t always know where a project will end up, and that’s okay. Spiral development lets ideas grow *naturally*, without needing everything to be perfect from the beginning.

## When It Shows Up

I use this approach in a lot of places:

- **Electronics** - rough circuits first, refine layout later  
- **Code** - quick working prototype, then structure it better  
- **Writing** - outline, messy draft, polish  
- **Workshops** - try a version, gather feedback, improve next time  

Each loop teaches me something new and that’s what makes the spiral stronger.
