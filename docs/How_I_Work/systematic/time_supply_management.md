# Time & Supply Management

Most of my work happens under real world limits, not ideal conditions. I’m often working with limited time, limited tools, or limited budget (and sometimes all three). So I’ve learned to be flexible and practical with what I have.

My mindset I often return to is:

> **Fast, good, cheap - pick two.**

If I want something done quickly and well, it probably won’t be cheap.  
If I want it cheap and fast, it might not be good.  
If I want it good and cheap, it will take time.

Knowing this helps me set realistic expectations — for myself and others.

## What I Focus On

Instead of chasing perfection, I try to:

- Make small, meaningful progress  
- Use what I already have before sourcing more  
- Reuse or repurpose materials creatively  
- Prioritize tasks that unblock others or clarify the path forward

## Managing Time

Time isn’t just about hours, it’s about energy, focus, and momentum. I manage time by:

- **Chunking** - big tasks into small, doable pieces  
- **Starting messy** - when I don’t know where to begin  
- **Looping back** - to improve, rather than delaying to plan perfectly  
- **Blocking time** - for focused work and protecting that space when I can

I also try to be honest with myself about when I’m actually productive, and not waste focus on things that don’t move the project forward.

## Managing Supplies

Especially in prototyping and lab work, supplies matter but I don’t always have access to everything I’d like.

Here’s how I approach it:

- **Inventory first** - I check what’s already available  
- **Hack creatively** - using parts or materials in unconventional ways  
- **Plan around constraints** - letting the available tools shape the design  
- **Share and ask** - if I can borrow or trade, I do  

Constraints aren’t a problem, they’re a creative tool. If I can’t afford to waste time or materials, I make that part of the design process.

## Why It Matters

Time and supply management isn’t just about being efficient, it’s about making progress in the real world.

Being resourceful, honest about tradeoffs, and willing to adapt helps me keep momentum, reduce stress, and focus on what actually matters.
