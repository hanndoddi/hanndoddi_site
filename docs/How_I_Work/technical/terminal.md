# Terminal

The terminal is where I feel most at home. I prefer tools that are fast, keyboard-driven, and easy to customize.

## Kitty <span class="icon"></span>

My terminal emulator of choice is [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). Yes, the name and cat icon won me over, but it's also genuinely fast, GPU-accelerated, and super customizable.

It works great with Neovim and supports features like:
- Tabbed layouts
- Graphics in the terminal
- Configurable keybindings
- Fast startup and rendering

## config

I don't config much I have Nerdfont, hide the boarder and make it transparent.

## Zsh <span class="icon">󱎃</span>

I use [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) because it’s highly configurable and offers smart completion, syntax highlighting, and autosuggestions. It's a joy to use once it’s tuned right.

## Starship 

I use [Starship](https://starship.rs/) to make my prompt clean, informative, and cat-friendly.

It gives me:
- Git integration
- Current directory, language versions, etc.
- A beautiful, minimal style

And of course it includes a cat icon.

## Terminal Tools 

These are some of the tools I use regularly in the terminal:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/): for version control and collaborating across projects  
- [`glow`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow): to preview Markdown directly in the terminal  
- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): fuzzy finder for quick file and history navigation  
- [`batcat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): a better `cat` with syntax highlighting and line numbers  
- [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit): a TUI for Git that’s simple and powerful  

These tools help me move fast, automate tasks, and stay in flow.
