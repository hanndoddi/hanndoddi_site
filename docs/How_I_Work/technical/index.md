# Techncal

My tools and workflows I use for technical work

## Design Tools

This section includes the tools I use for visual design, 2D and 3D modeling, electronics layout, and general creative work.

I’m not a designer in the traditional sense, but I often need to communicate ideas visually — whether that’s through schematics, technical drawings, renders, or illustrations.

These tools help me do that in a way that’s clear, practical, and sometimes even fun.
