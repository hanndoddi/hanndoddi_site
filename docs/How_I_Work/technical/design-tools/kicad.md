# KiCad

KiCad is my go-to for PCB design and electronic schematics. I like how it gives me full control over the layout, and how customizable it is.

I use it for:
- Schematic capture and BOM generation
- PCB layout (1-4 layers)
- Gerber exports for fab
- 3D previews for fit checks

I keep my libraries organized in subfolders to avoid clutter, and I store them in my home directory.
