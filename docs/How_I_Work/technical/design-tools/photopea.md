# Photopea

Photopea is a browser-based image editor that works like Photoshop — but without the install or the cost.

I use it for quick image editing, layout tweaks, and small design tasks where I don’t want to open a full graphics suite.

What I like:
- Works in the browser
- Supports PSD, SVG, and export formats
- Great for quick fixes and mockups

It’s perfect for working on a borrowed machine or making last-minute edits on the go.
