# PlatformIO

PlatformIO is my preferred environment for embedded development in C and C++. It supports a wide range of boards and platforms, and integrates well with both VS Code and Neovim.

I use it because:
- It’s flexible and portable
- It handles build and upload tools automatically
- It’s easy to manage dependencies across projects

It also plays nicely with Git and lets me keep my firmware projects version-controlled and reproducible.
