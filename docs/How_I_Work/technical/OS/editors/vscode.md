# Visual Studio Code

I used VS Code for a long time and still use it occasionally for specific tasks. It's a solid editor with a great extension ecosystem and excellent support for a wide range of languages and platforms.

## Why I used it

VS Code helped me get started with embedded programming, web development, and Markdown documentation. It’s easy to set up and works out of the box for most workflows.

Some features I appreciated:
- Built-in Git integration
- Markdown preview and export tools
- PlatformIO support for embedded development
- Great debugging interface

## Why I switched (mostly)

Over time, I wanted more control and a setup that was faster and more terminal-oriented. That’s what led me to Neovim.

VS Code can still be useful for:
- Projects that need GUI-based debugging
- Working with others who use it
- Quick editing or reviewing files

## When I still use it

I’ll occasionally open VS Code when:
- I need to export a nicely formatted PDF from Markdown
- I'm on a system where my Neovim setup isn’t installed

It's a good tool and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to beginners or collaborators. I just found something that fits my workflow better.
