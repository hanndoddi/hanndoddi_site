# Python

Python is the language I reach for when I want to build something quickly, script a workflow, or teach programming.

It’s simple, expressive, and supported almost everywhere — which makes it ideal for prototyping, automation, and working with students.

I use Python in:
- MicroPython projects
- Data analysis
- Command-line tools
- Markdown and build automation

It’s not always the fastest language, but it's flexible and gets the job done.
