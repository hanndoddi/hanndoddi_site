# R

I don’t use R daily, but I’ve used it when working with data analysis, visualization, or statistical work.

It’s powerful for data-heavy projects — especially when I want quick plots, summaries, or transformations.

I tend to use it in specific situations rather than general scripting, but it’s a useful tool to have in the box.
