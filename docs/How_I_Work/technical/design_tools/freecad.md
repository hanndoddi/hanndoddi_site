# FreeCAD

FreeCAD is my main tool for parametric 3D modeling. I use it for designing enclosures, brackets, fixtures, and any parts I need to 3D print or machine.

What I like:
- Full parametric control
- Open file format
- Integration with KiCad for board and case fit

I don’t use every feature, but I’ve built a solid workflow around sketching, constraints, and exporting STL/STEP files.
