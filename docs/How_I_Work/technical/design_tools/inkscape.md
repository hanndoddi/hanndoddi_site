# Inkscape

Inkscape is my main tool for 2D vector design â€” especially when working on laser cutting, vinyl cutting, or making diagrams.

It works great for:
- SVG exports to machines
- Front panel and PCB artwork
- Simple icons and illustrations

I like how it plays well with other tools in my workflow, and it's lightweight enough to run on almost anything.
