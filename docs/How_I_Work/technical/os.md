# OS

## Linux Mint 🐧

This is my daily driver. It’s lightweight, stable, and works great for development, especially for embedded work. Cinnamon is my preferred desktop environment because it stays out of the way and feels familiar.

## Windows 🪟

I use Windows occasionally for specific tools like VCarve or when working with students or clients using Windows-only software. Dual boot or virtualization comes in handy, but Linux is where I live most of the time and I don't use dual boot.
