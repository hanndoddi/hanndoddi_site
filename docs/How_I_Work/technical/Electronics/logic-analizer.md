# Logic Analyzer

A logic analyzer is one of those tools you don’t always need, until you really need it.  
It’s perfect for visualizing and debugging digital communication protocols like I²C, SPI, UART, and more.

---

## What it’s for

- Debugging serial protocols
- Seeing the actual data on digital lines
- Finding timing issues or unexpected noise
- Reverse engineering or tapping into unknown devices

---

## How I use it

- Verifying that I²C devices are responding properly
- Checking baud rates and data flow on UART
- Confirming SPI timing between a microcontroller and a peripheral
- Triggering capture on a specific condition to catch rare events

---

## Types

- **USB analyzers** – Small, affordable, and powered by software like [PulseView](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads) or DSView. Great for most hobbyist work.
- **Standalone analyzers** – More advanced models exist, but I don’t use them often.

## Tips & Usage Notes

- Keep wire lengths short — long flying leads can introduce noise
- Label channels clearly in software to avoid confusion
- Triggering is your best friend: set it carefully
- Sample rate matters — make sure it’s at least **4–5×** your expected signal frequency
- It’s okay to start with an 8-channel analyzer — you rarely need more right away

## Software

- [DSView](https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/) – the one I use
- [PulseView (Sigrok)](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads) – open source, widely supported
