# Soldering

Soldering is core to almost everything I build — from fixing broken connections to assembling full prototypes.  
It’s a skill that rewards practice, patience, and the right mindset (and tip temperature).

## What it’s for

- Making electrical connections between components and boards
- Repairing broken joints or wires
- Assembling circuits on perfboard, stripboard, or custom PCBs
- Modifying or hacking existing hardware
- Making or fixing cablels

---

## How I approach it

- I keep a few different tips on hand — chisel, conical, and fine-point
- 350–380°C is my general temp range, lower for tiny SMD parts
- I try to use flux often — it’s a cheat code for clean soldering
- I solder components from lowest to highest profile (resistors → headers)

## Tools I keep nearby

- Soldering iron with adjustable temperature
- Flux pen or paste
- Desoldering pump or braid
- Helping hands or PCB holders
- Isopropyl alcohol + brush for cleanup

---

## Tips & Notes

- Keep your tip clean — wipe and re-tin regularly
- Don’t overheat pads, especially on cheap PCBs
- If it’s not flowing well, back off and apply flux
- Desoldering is a skill of its own — go slow
- A microscope or magnifier really helps for SMD work

## For Teaching

- Start with through-hole, then move to SMD when students are comfortable
- Show how to fix a cold joint — don’t just explain it
- Let people fail safely — most mistakes are recoverable
