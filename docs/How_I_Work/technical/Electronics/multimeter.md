# Multimeter

The multimeter is one of the most essential tools on the bench. It’s not fancy, it does’t blink, but it answers important questions fast.

It’s usually the first or second tool I grab when debugging, especially for power, continuity, or basic readings.

## What it’s for

- Checking if something has power
- Measuring voltage, resistance, and current
- Continuity and diode tests
- Quick sanity checks on sensors, power rails, or broken traces

---

## Modes I use the most

- **Voltage (DC)** – for checking micro controllers, sensors, or power rails
- **Continuity** – for testing traces, jumpers, or verifying solder joints
- **Resistance** – for checking resistors or passive components
- **Current (less often)** – used with care, since it requires breaking the circuit

## Tips & Usage Notes

- Always start with voltage mode before poking around
- Continuity mode with audio beep is a time saver
- Use clips or third hands when probing awkward spots
- Cheap multimeters can be fine — but a stable reading matters more than the brand

## Safety Notes

- Be cautious when measuring current, especially in unknown circuits
- Don’t switch modes while probing live connections
- Always check your probe placement and lead configuration before powering up
