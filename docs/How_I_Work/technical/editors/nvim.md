# Neovim (I use Neovim btw)

I mainly started using Neovim because I wanted to look like a cool hacker.(Don’t worry, I’m not much of a danger)

After getting over how cool it looked and spending days configuring it, I discovered that it’s actually a really nice workflow.

## Setup

For anyone just starting out, I’d recommend checking out [kickstart nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim{:rel="nofollow"} ).  
It’s a great minimal starter config.

There’s also [this video](https://youtu.be/6pAG3BHurdM?si=Q-vdsjJOm6IU9Qy6){:rel="nofollow"}  that I *really* wish I’d found earlier.

I now use my own custom setup, inspired by Kickstart and a few other configs I’ve found along the way.

## My Setup

You’re more than welcome to explore (or fork) my Neovim config.  
But I highly recommend customizing it to suit **your** needs.

My take:
- Don’t force Neovim to act like VS Code.
- If you’re happy with your current editor — keep using it!

Neovim is awesome if it works for you.  
Happens to work for me.
