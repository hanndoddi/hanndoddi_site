# MicroPython

I use MicroPython when I want to build something quickly with a microcontroller and keep the code lightweight and readable.

It’s perfect for teaching, prototyping, and small-scale automation — especially with boards like the RP2040.

I like that I can:
- Write and test code in real time
- Avoid long compile/upload cycles
- Use Python syntax in embedded environments

It lowers the entry barrier without sacrificing too much power.
