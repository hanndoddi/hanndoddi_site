# Arduino IDE

I used the Arduino IDE when I was getting started, and I still return to it occasionally — especially for teaching or when working with beginners.

It’s simple, approachable, and has a huge community behind it.

Most of my Arduino-based projects now run through PlatformIO, but I keep the IDE around for:
- Quick testing
- Troubleshooting bootloaders
- Demonstrating the basics
