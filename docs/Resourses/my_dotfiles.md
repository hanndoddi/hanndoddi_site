# My Dotfiles

> Where the goal is perfection but I'm usually just happy that it sort of works.

These dotfiles are tuned for speed, clarity, and some chaos.  
They cover my setup for terminal workflows, file browsing, and editing.

My dotfiles aren't perfect. They're still evolving, and someday they'll grow old and die... just like me. (No worries, my health is fine.)
